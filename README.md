Protein language models (PLMs) are powerful tools for understanding and designing proteins using deep learning techniques. They work similarly to natural language models but are trained on protein sequences to predict structures, functions, and interactions or braodly specific phenotypes.This repo is dedicated to using ESM2 models for various tasks. It will be updated periodically.
